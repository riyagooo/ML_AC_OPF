## Introduction to GNNs for Power Systems

Power systems have an inherent graph structure, with buses as nodes and transmission lines as edges. Traditional neural networks ignore this structure, treating inputs as flat vectors. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) explicitly model this topological information, enabling more accurate predictions.

Key advantages of using GNNs for power systems include:

1. **Topology Awareness**: GNNs naturally incorporate the connectivity information of the power system.
2. **Permutation Invariance**: The order of buses in the input doesn't affect the model outputs.
3. **Locality**: Power flow is governed by local physical laws, which GNNs can capture through message passing.
4. **Transferability**: GNNs trained on one network topology can potentially generalize to different topologies.

## Graph Representation of Power Systems

### Node and Edge Features

In our implementation, the IEEE 39-bus system is represented as a graph $G = (V, E)$ where:

- $V$ is the set of buses (nodes)
- $E$ is the set of transmission lines (edges)

Each node $v_i \in V$ has features $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v}$ that include:

- Generator active and reactive power setpoints ($P_G$, $Q_G$) if a generator is present
- Load active and reactive power demands ($P_D$, $Q_D$)
- Voltage magnitude and angle setpoints ($V$, $\theta$)
- Bus type indicator (PV, PQ, slack)

Each edge $(i, j) \in E$ connecting nodes $i$ and $j$ has features $e_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_e}$ that include:

- Line resistance $R_{ij}$
- Line reactance $X_{ij}$
- Line charging susceptance $B_{sh,ij}$
- Line thermal limit $S_{ij}^{max}$

### Mathematical Formulation

The adjacency matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ of the power system graph is defined as:

$$A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if there is a transmission line between buses $i$ and $j$} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

The node feature matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v}$ contains the features of all nodes, where $n$ is the number of buses and $d_v$ is the dimension of node features.

The edge feature tensor $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n \times d_e}$ contains the features of all edges, where $d_e$ is the dimension of edge features.

## Standard GNN Architecture

### Message Passing Framework

Our GNN implementation follows the message passing neural network (MPNN) framework, which consists of three main components:

1. **Message Function**: Computes messages between connected nodes
2. **Aggregation Function**: Combines messages from neighboring nodes
3. **Update Function**: Updates node representations based on aggregated messages

Mathematically, for node $i$ at layer $l$, the message passing operation is:

$$h_i^{(l+1)} = \text{UPDATE}^{(l)}\left(h_i^{(l)}, \text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)}\left(\{\text{MESSAGE}^{(l)}(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}, e_{ij}) : j \in \mathcal{N}(i)\}\right)\right)$$

Where:
- $h_i^{(l)}$ is the hidden representation of node $i$ at layer $l$
- $\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighboring nodes of node $i$
- $e_{ij}$ is the edge feature vector for the edge connecting nodes $i$ and $j$

### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

Our primary GNN architecture is based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), which simplifies the message passing framework with a specific form:

$$H^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\tilde{A}\tilde{D}^{-\frac{1}{2}}H^{(l)}W^{(l)}\right)$$

Where:
- $H^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_l}$ is the matrix of node features at layer $l$
- $\tilde{A} = A + I_n$ is the adjacency matrix with added self-loops
- $\tilde{D}_{ii} = \sum_j \tilde{A}_{ij}$ is the degree matrix of $\tilde{A}$
- $W^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_l \times d_{l+1}}$ is the weight matrix for layer $l$
- $\sigma$ is a non-linear activation function (ReLU in our implementation)

For a single node $i$, this operation can be written as:

$$h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(W^{(l)} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\text{deg}(i) + 1)}} \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i) \cup \{i\}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\text{deg}(j) + 1)}} h_j^{(l)}\right)$$

### Edge-Enhanced GNN

For some applications, we enhanced the standard GCN by incorporating edge features:

$$h_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(W^{(l)}h_i^{(l)} + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{deg}(i) \cdot \text{deg}(j)}} \cdot W_e^{(l)}(h_j^{(l)} \odot M_{ij}e_{ij})\right)$$

Where:
- $W_e^{(l)}$ is an additional weight matrix for edge feature transformation
- $M_{ij}$ is a learnable transformation matrix for edge features
- $\odot$ represents element-wise multiplication

### Global Pooling Layer

After message passing, we apply global pooling to get a graph-level representation:

$$h_G = \text{POOL}(\{h_i^{(L)} : i \in V\})$$

We implemented different pooling strategies:

1. **Mean Pooling**: $h_G = \frac{1}{|V|} \sum_{i \in V} h_i^{(L)}$
2. **Max Pooling**: $h_G = \max_{i \in V} h_i^{(L)}$ (element-wise max)
3. **Attention-based Pooling**: $h_G = \sum_{i \in V} \alpha_i h_i^{(L)}$ where $\alpha_i$ are learnable attention weights

## Advanced GNN Architecture

Our advanced GNN implementation includes several recent techniques from the literature to enhance performance:

### MixtralActivation

Inspired by mixture-of-experts approaches [11], we implement a learnable mixture of activation functions:

```python
class MixtralActivation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim):
        super(MixtralActivation, self).__init__()
        self.activations = [
            F.relu,
            torch.tanh,
            F.leaky_relu,
            F.gelu,
            lambda x: x * torch.sigmoid(x)  # swish
        ]
        # Learnable weights for each activation function
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(len(self.activations)))
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Weighted sum of all activation functions
        weights = F.softmax(self.weights, dim=0)
        return sum(w * act(x) for w, act in zip(weights, self.activations))
```

This allows the model to adaptively choose the most appropriate activation function for different parts of the input space, which is particularly beneficial for power systems with their complex nonlinearities.

### Orthogonal Initialization

We improve training stability and gradient flow using orthogonal initialization [12]:

```python
def _init_weights(self):
    for m in self.modules():
        if isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
            # Use orthogonal initialization for better gradient flow
            nn.init.orthogonal_(m.weight, gain=1.0)
            if m.bias is not None:
                nn.init.zeros_(m.bias)
```

### Learning Rate Warmup

To improve optimization stability in the early stages of training, we implement a learning rate warmup strategy [13] where the learning rate gradually increases for the first few epochs:

```python
# Apply learning rate warmup
if epoch < warmup_epochs:
    # Linear warmup
    lr = initial_lr * (epoch + 1) / warmup_epochs
    for param_group in optimizer.param_groups:
        param_group['lr'] = lr
```

### Physics-Informed Message Passing

The core of our advanced GNN implementation is the `EnhancedPhysicsMessagePassing` layer that explicitly models power system interactions:

```
[Source Node Features, Target Node Features, Edge Features] → 
  → Path 1 (Linear → LeakyReLU → LayerNorm → Linear) →
  → Path 2 (Linear → GELU → LayerNorm → Linear) →
  → Path Attention → Weighted Combination →
  → Message Scaling based on Node Relationship
```

This allows the model to process the same inputs through different activation functions, capturing both sharp transitions (LeakyReLU) and smooth approximations (GELU).

### Multiple Message Paths

The message function uses two parallel paths with different activation functions to capture various aspects of power system physics:

```python
class EnhancedPhysicsMessagePassing(MessagePassing):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim, activation='leaky_relu', edge_dim=4, aggr="add"):
        super(EnhancedPhysicsMessagePassing, self).__init__(aggr=aggr)
        
        # Message transformation with multiple paths
        self.message_path1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2 + edge_dim, hidden_dim),
            ActivationSelector(activation),
            nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        )
        
        self.message_path2 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2 + edge_dim, hidden_dim),
            ActivationSelector('gelu'),
            nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        )
        
        # Path attention mechanism
        self.path_attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2, 2),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
```

### Gated Update Mechanism

The gating mechanism controls how much information from the message should update the node's state:

```python
def update(self, aggr_out, x):
    # Combine aggregated messages with node's previous state
    update_input = torch.cat([aggr_out, x], dim=1)
    
    # Calculate gate values to control information flow
    gate_value = self.gate(update_input)
    
    # Process through update layers with residual connection
    update1 = self.update_layer1(update_input)
    update2 = x + self.update_layer2(update1)  # Residual
    
    # Apply gating mechanism for final update
    return x * (1 - gate_value) + update2 * gate_value
```

This approach is inspired by gated recurrent units (GRUs) and allows the model to selectively update node features based on the relevance of the incoming messages.

### Layer Attention Mechanism

To better leverage the hierarchical representations learned at different layers, we implement a layer attention mechanism:

```python
def forward(self, data):
    """Forward pass for advanced GNN"""
    x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
    edge_attr = data.edge_attr if hasattr(data, 'edge_attr') else None
    
    # Initial embedding
    x = self.node_embedding(x)
    
    # Store per-layer outputs for layer attention
    layer_outputs = []
    
    # Apply message passing layers
    for i, (mp, norm, has_res) in enumerate(zip(self.mp_layers, self.norms, self.has_residual)):
        # Message passing, normalization, etc.
        # ...
        
        # Store layer output
        if self.use_layer_attention:
            layer_outputs.append(x)
    
    # Apply layer attention if enabled
    if self.use_layer_attention and len(layer_outputs) > 0:
        # Normalize attention weights
        attn = F.softmax(self.layer_attention, dim=0)
        
        # Weighted sum of layer outputs
        x = sum(w * out for w, out in zip(attn, layer_outputs))
```

### Power System Embedding

For node features, we use a specialized embedding layer that applies domain-specific transformations:

```python
class PowerSystemEmbedding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(PowerSystemEmbedding, self).__init__()
        
        # Main linear transformation
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)
        
        # Power domain-specific transformations
        self.power_transform = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim // 2)
        
        # Final layer to combine transformations
        self.combine = nn.Linear(output_dim + output_dim // 2, output_dim)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Standard linear transformation
        linear_out = self.linear(x)
        
        # Power system domain transformations (quadratic terms for power flow)
        power_squared = x**2
        power_out = self.power_transform(power_squared)
        
        # Concatenate different transformations
        combined = torch.cat([linear_out, power_out], dim=-1)
        
        # Final output
        x = self.combine(combined)
        
        return x
```

## Physics-Informed Message Passing

Our physics-informed message passing approach is designed to capture the specific characteristics of power systems:

### Edge Features Integration

Line parameters (resistance, reactance, susceptance, thermal limits) are explicitly incorporated as edge features:

```python
# Define edge attributes with physics-based information
edge_attrs = {}

for edge in edges:
    # Use realistic line parameters
    resistance = random.uniform(0.01, 0.05)
    reactance = random.uniform(0.1, 0.5)
    susceptance = random.uniform(0.01, 0.1)
    thermal_limit = random.uniform(0.8, 1.2)
    
    # Store parameters in both directions (undirected graph)
    edge_attrs[edge] = [resistance, reactance, susceptance, thermal_limit]
    edge_attrs[(edge[1], edge[0])] = [resistance, reactance, susceptance, thermal_limit]
```

These edge features are processed by the message function to model how power flows through the transmission lines.

### Distance-Based Scaling

The message passing operation scales messages based on the relationship between nodes:

```python
# Scale messages by distance between nodes
# Self-loops (i==j) get a weight of 1.0, others get scale_factor
is_self = (x_i == x_j).all(dim=1, keepdim=True)
scale = torch.where(is_self, torch.ones_like(self.scale_factor), self.scale_factor)
        
return message * scale
```

This allows the model to distinguish between self-information and neighbor information, similar to how power flow behaves differently for local and remote buses.

    def __init__(self, node_features, hidden_dim, output_dim, 
                 num_layers=4, dropout_rate=0.2, activation='leaky_relu',
                 edge_features=4, use_layer_attention=True):
        super(AdvancedGNN, self).__init__()
        
        # Input embedding for nodes with power-specific transformations

        # Message passing layers with physics-informed functions
        self.mp_layers = nn.ModuleList()
        for i in range(num_layers):
            # Alternate between different activation functions
            layer_activation = 'gelu' if i % 2 == 1 else activation
            self.mp_layers.append(EnhancedPhysicsMessagePassing(
                hidden_dim, activation=layer_activation, edge_dim=edge_features
            ))
        
        # Batch normalization after each layer
        self.norms = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim) for _ in range(num_layers)
        ])
        
        # Residual connections for every other layer
        self.has_residual = [i % 2 == 1 for i in range(num_layers)]
        
        # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        
        # Layer attention mechanism (optional)
        self.use_layer_attention = use_layer_attention
        if use_layer_attention:
            self.layer_attention = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_layers) / num_layers)
        
        # Final output layers
        self.pre_output = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim),
            ActivationSelector(activation),
            nn.LayerNorm(hidden_dim),
            nn.Dropout(dropout_rate/2),
            nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim//2),
            ActivationSelector(activation)
        )
        
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim//2, output_dim)
```

### IEEE 39-Bus System Graph Construction

The IEEE 39-bus system contains 39 buses and 46 transmission lines. The adjacency list representation used in our implementation is:

```python
edges = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8),

    (34, 36), (35, 37), (36, 37), (36, 38), (37, 38)
]
```

## Training Process

### PyTorch Geometric Implementation

We use PyTorch Geometric (PyG) for implementing GNNs. The training process involves:

1. **Data Preparation**: Convert power system data to PyG `Data` objects
2. **Batching**: Use PyG's `DataLoader` to create batches of graphs
3. **Forward Pass**: Pass batches through the GNN model
4. **Loss Calculation**: Compute task-specific loss (MSE for direct prediction, BCE for constraint screening)
5. **Backward Pass**: Update model parameters using Adam optimizer

### Early Stopping and Regularization

To prevent overfitting, we implemented:

1. **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation loss and stop training if it doesn't improve for a specified number of epochs (patience=10)
2. **Dropout**: Apply dropout after each GNN layer (rate=0.2 for direct prediction, 0.3 for constraint screening)
3. **Batch Normalization**: Normalize layer outputs to improve training stability
4. **Weight Decay**: Apply L2 regularization to model parameters (1e-5 for direct prediction, 1e-4 for constraint screening)
